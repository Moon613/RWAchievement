A feature addition mod that lets you view your Steam achievements!


With this, you can now view your Steam Achievements while in-game via a dedicated menu, accessible from the main menu, featuring custom art for some vanilla game achievements made by community members.


Artwork currently in the mod can be attributed to these lovely people below:
- SAPatry
- StormTheCat


Translation help:
- Slithers (Spanish)


Modding support included! Other mods can add their own achievements to the mix!
